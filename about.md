I am currently PhD student from the [David Cheriton School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/) and intend on graduating in 2018. 

## Research Interests
My research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and optimization. Currently, I am most interested in algorithms for structured sparsity, e.g. sparse or low-rank optimization. Specifically, I have looked into creating variants of Frank-Wolfe type methods for efficiently solving nuclear norm and/or element-wise l1-norm constrained problems.

Below are a few topics of interest:
 
* [Semi-supervised learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-supervised_learning)
*  Structured optimization methods (e.g. [Frank-Wolfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank%E2%80%93Wolfe_algorithm), [Proximal Gradient Descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximal_gradient_method), [ADMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_Lagrangian_method#Alternating_direction_method_of_multipliers))
*  [Sum-of-squares optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sum-of-squares_optimization)
* [Tensor Learning Problems](http://www.offconvex.org/2015/12/17/tensor-decompositions/)
